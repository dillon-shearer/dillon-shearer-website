## **Intro**

Gun violence is a hot topic in the United States. We have many rights that other countries do not; including the right to bear arms. We reap the benefits, but we also face the consequences.

My objective in this blog post is to take an unbiased view and determine what the data says about this topic. I found as many credible sources to piece together the full story as I could.

That being said: enjoy this tale of the relationship between the United States and her firearm-wielding constituents.
