summary: 'A deep integration of my love for lifting and data; built with a live dashboard, strict-form data entry, API access, and full analytics.'

I just added a new gym tracking dashboard to my website. It is fully integrated end to end and built exactly the way I want to track my progress.

There is now a mobile-friendly input form that forces clean and consistent data entry. Every set I log goes straight into a PostgreSQL database. From there, the dashboard lets me explore my training across different time ranges, like week, month, or year, and actually see patterns in my lifting volume and performance over time.

I also exposed an API endpoint so anyone can download my lifting data in either CSV or JSON format. The output is intentionally raw and complete, because I want it to be useful for analysis, future modeling, or other people who care about clean gym data.

This is one of those projects that sits directly at the intersection of what I do for work and what I love. Lifting is a huge part of my daily life, and having full control over my own data just makes sense to me. No third party apps, no hidden assumptions, no guessing. Just truth in and truth out.

This is the first version, but I plan to keep building on it over time.

Much love,
Dillon
