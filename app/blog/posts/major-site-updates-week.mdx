title: 'Site Updates: Contact Forms, Notebooks, and New Dashboard'

summary: 'Added some new functionality this week including a working contact form, Jupyter notebook viewer, and an interactive materials dashboard demo.'

I spent this week adding some new features to the site that I'm pretty happy with. The biggest change is probably the **contact form** - it actually works now thanks to Resend integration, so if you reach out I'll actually get your message. Also cleaned up the **About Me** page to better explain my background and how I ended up in healthcare data science.

## Jupyter Notebook Viewer

The most technically interesting addition is the Jupyter notebook viewer. You can now browse my actual data science notebooks directly in the browser, complete with code, outputs, and visualizations. It renders everything properly including pandas dataframes and matplotlib plots, which was trickier than expected but worth the effort.

## Interactive Materials Dashboard

I also built a new interactive dashboard demo for materials inventory management. It's got about 90 synthetic materials with real-time status tracking, scenario planning, and dynamic KPIs. You can manipulate the data and watch everything update automatically - things like triggering supply chain crises or adjusting individual inventory levels. The whole dataset is downloadable too if you want to play with it.

The dashboard demonstrates some complex state management and business logic, with inventory status calculations, risk assessments, and realistic industry metrics. It's built with **React and TypeScript**, fully responsive, and handles everything from simple stock tracking to multi-variable scenario analysis.

## Why This Matters

These updates make the site feel more like a working platform than just a static portfolio. The notebook viewer lets people see my actual analytical process, the dashboard shows full-stack development skills, and the contact form removes friction for anyone wanting to connect.

Check out the [demos page](/demos) to try the dashboard yourself, or browse the [notebooks section](/jupyter) to see some real data science work. Always interested in feedback, especially from other developers who can appreciate the technical details.
