summary: 'Added some new functionality this week including a working contact form and Jupyter notebook viewer.'

I spent this week adding some new features to the site that I'm pretty happy with. The biggest change is probably the **contact form** - it actually works now thanks to Resend integration, so if you reach out I'll actually get your message. Also cleaned up the **About Me** page to better explain my background and how I ended up in healthcare data science.

## Jupyter Notebook Viewer

The most technically interesting addition is the Jupyter notebook viewer. You can now browse my actual data science notebooks directly in the browser, complete with code, outputs, and visualizations. It renders everything properly including pandas dataframes and matplotlib plots, which was trickier than expected but worth the effort.

## Why This Matters

These updates make the site feel more like a working platform than just a static portfolio. The notebook viewer lets people see my actual analytical process, and the contact form removes friction for anyone wanting to connect.

Browse the [notebooks section](/jupyter) to see some real data science work, or check out the [demos page](/demos) for interactive projects. Always interested in feedback, especially from other developers who can appreciate the technical details.
