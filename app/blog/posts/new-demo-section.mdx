I'm excited to finally continue adding to my personal website - check out my new "Demos" section!

## What you'll find

This page is designed to house my projects for anyone to see. This is a space for me to publish my work in a fully polished form. This page features:
- **Live demonstrations**
- **Source Code and Documentation**
- **Tech Stack Details**
- **Development Insights/Lessons Learned**

## Why I build this

In 2025 it is essential for everyone to utilize new tools and technologies to better themselves and their careers. This is my adventure in staying up to date, continue expanding my portfolio, and share my work with anyone who may be interested. If a picture tells a thousand words, then a production ready demo shows a thousand pictures.

## The Tech Behind It

The demos page itself is built with:
- **Next.js 14** with the app router
- **TypeScript** for type safety  
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Responsive design** that works on any device

## What's Next

I'm planning to add a new demo every few weeks as I work on different projects. Some upcoming demos I'm excited to share:
- A real-time data dashboard
- An interactive API documentation tool
- A component library with Storybook

## Check It Out

Head over to the [**Demos page**](/demos) and let me know what you think! I'd love to hear your feedback or answer any questions about the projects.
